Project Description: 
          This is a full Backend Project. In this project, I have created a bicycle store. In this store, you can see the list of Products. You can add a bicycle to the store. You can also delete a bicycle from the store. I have used MongoDB as the database. I have used TypeScript for type checking. I have used Mongoose for database connection. I have used esLint for code formatting. I have hosted this project on Vercel.I have used the       following API endpoints in this project: 
              1. GET /api/products To get all products from the store.
              2. POST /api/products To add a product to the store.
              3. DELETE /api/products/:id To delete a product from the store.
              4. GET /api/products/:id To get a specific product by id from the store.
              5. PUT /api/products/:id To update a specific product by id from the store.
          I have also create a Order file where you can see the list of orders. You can add an order to the store. You can also delete an order from the store. I have used the following API endpoints in this project: 
              1. GET /api/orders To get all orders from the store.
